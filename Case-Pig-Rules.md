# Case: Pig Rules
**22th June 2024**

## Executive Summary
This report details the process of detecting port scanning activity using Snort and TCPdump. The investigation was conducted to identify and mitigate potential security threats on a network. The approach involved capturing network traffic, filtering relevant data, creating custom Snort rules, and monitoring alerts through Snorby. The outcome was successful identification and classification of port scanning attempts, providing a clear demonstration of the effectiveness of network intrusion detection systems.

## Findings and Analysis

### **Network-related findings**
| **Field**               | **Value**               | **Description**                                            |
|:------------------------|:------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source IP**            | 172.29.0.1              | The source IP from which the port scan originated.           |
| **Destination IP**       | 172.29.0.3              | This was the Targeted IP.                                     |
| **Ports**                | Various Ports.           | The attacker attempts to establish connections on multiple ports. |
| **Attack Type**          | Port Scanning.           | The consistent SYN packets signify a port scanning.            |
| **FLAG: MD5 Hash**       | 1fdcf70d937c1d1796a53fb4fdb9e79c | The completion of challenge flag.                             |
| **TCP SYN Packets**      | Consistent pattern       | Represents connection initiation attempts typical of port scans. |
| **Snort Alert ID**       | 1:1000001:1              | Custom rule created to detect port scans, successfully triggered. |

**Note:** This pattern indicates a port scan, where an attacker is attempting to find open ports on a target machine. The consistent SYN packets signify an attempt to establish connections on multiple ports.

## Methodology

### Tools and Technologies Used
**TCPdump:** A command-line packet analyzer used for capturing and filtering network traffic.

- **Reason:** Utilized to capture incoming TCP SYN packets that are indicative of connection attempts and potential port scans.

**Snort:** An open-source network intrusion detection system (NIDS).

- **Reason:** Used to monitor network traffic and generate alerts based on custom rules for identifying suspicious activities.

**Snorby:** *A web-based frontend for Snort.*

- **Reason:** Employed to visualize and classify the alerts generated by Snort.

**nano:** A command-line text editor.

- **Reason:** Used to create and edit Snort rule files for defining custom detection rules.

## Investigation Process

### The first step: Initial Traffic Capture
I started by capturing all incoming traffic on interface `eth0` using the **tcpdump** utility by executing the command:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0
```

### The Second step: Filtered Traffic Capture.

The second step was to capture only TCP SYN packets on interface eth0 by using the command: 
```bash
sudo tcpdump -n -i eth0 'tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn) != 0'
```
This action isolated connection 
attempts that are common indicators of port scans and narrowed down the data to relevant 
traffic for further analysis.

The captured packets show repeated attempts to connect from IP address `172.29.0.1` to various 
ports on IP address `172.29.0.3`. This indicates multiple TCP connection attempts. This might be 
an indicate of a port scanning.

## Step Three: Creating a Custom Snort Rule

I decided to add a custom rule to Snort to detect multiple SYN packets from the same source based on the Second step assumption. I edited the local rules file with the command:  
```bash
nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
```
and added the following rule `alert tcp any any -> any 1:1024 (msg:"Potential Port Scan Detected"; flags:S; threshold:type both, track by_src, count 10, seconds 2; sid:1000001; rev:1;)`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b905ba6-ac30-4364-b2fe-5cae469a54b9)

This rule alerts on potential port scans by detecting multiple SYN packets from the same source 
within a short time frame. After creating the rule, I pressed Ctrl+O to save the editing and 
Ctrl+X to exit the file.

## Step Four: Running Snort with the New Rule. 

I ran Snort in detection mode to monitor the filtered traffic by executing the command: 
```
sudo 
snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A console. Then waited a few second and I received an alert:
```

This alert indicated the detection of potential port scanning activities, confirming that the custom 
rule was effectively isolating and identifying relevant traffic.

## Step Five: Running Snort. 

I then quickly opened a new tab and sent the filtered traffic to Snorby by executing the 
command: 
```
sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

## Step Six: Scanning the targeted file 

Next, I logged in to Snorby using the provided credentials. On the right side of the dashboard, 
there were alerts displaying the unique rule ID that I had created, confirming that the rule was 
successfully detecting and reporting the specified traffic.

Then clicked on one of them

- The source IP and the destination IP are as expected based on the network traffic. Then clicked: 
Perform Mass Classification option on the top right side of the screen as shown:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae0ac865-c5df-4de9-9ece-9bab5e5c0f59)

- Then I found the Flag which is the MD5 hash: 1fdcf70d937c1d1796a53fb4fdb9e79c. then 
submitted the flag and win the challenge.
